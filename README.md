# RAIBO2 Simulation Code Repository

## Overview
This repository contains the simulation code for RAIBO2, a highly efficient quadruped robot capable of completing a full marathon with a single battery charge. The work is presented in our paper published in Nature: "RAIBO2: Highly efficient quadruped robot completing full marathon with a single battery charge".

## Code Availability Notice
As stated in our publication, we are making the simulation code for RAIBO2 locomotion available upon reasonable request. This repository serves as the central location for code distribution to researchers who wish to build upon our work.


## Data Availability
All data presented in the paper are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14825866.


## Acknowledgments
We thank all contributors and supporting institutions as mentioned in our published paper.
